# Book-Search-Engine

For this project, we made an application, where we are able to login, and search for books, saving them to our profile. We are then able to click on the profile, and view the books that have been saved. When Looking up the books, we are able to see the book's information, as well as the image for each respective book. Each book has it's own individual card. 
 I initially had the home webpage, as well as the movie search working, however when trying to bugfix the login screen, I managed to break the functionality of the entire webpage. I tried for 3 hours trying different methods of bugfixing, asking friends, as well as looking up potential problems on chat gpt. However I think in the process of my own coding, my friend's trying to help, as well as trying to look up potential issues, that I broke the code worse than I intially had it. I kept receiving an error on my prevent.default() on my SearchBooks.jsx file. The error didn't specify anything past that, and I couldn't find any way to resolve the error that it was receiving, preventing the webpage from loading at all.
